# small-pico8-demos
Code I have written appears in the .p8 file within each separate project's sub-directory. Automatically-generated binary files are also provided for multiple operating systems so that the programs can be run.

## Notes:
* The default PICO-8 IDE has a very zoomed-in view that cannot be changed, thus many of my longer statements and comments are written across multiple lines for easier understanding whilst programming;
* PICO-8 omits a few features of Lua and provides a few extra shortcuts/functions of its own due to its primary role as a game development software;
* Letters in PICO-8 cannot be capitalised, and spaces/tabs provide the same amount of indentation within the IDE, which explains potential oddities in my code's presentation.
